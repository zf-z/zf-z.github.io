I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Civil Department, [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Hai Yang](http://cehyang.people.ust.hk/), Hong Kong. My primary research interests inlcude smart mobility and data-driven study in tranportation for some emerging problems, including: 
- **Emerging Smart Mobility Service**
    - Ride-sourcing markets
     - Pricing and regulations
     - Ride-pooling matching mechanism
    - Bike Sharing
- **Artificial Intelligence for Transportation**
    - Machine Learning for OD/speed/flow prediction
    - Reinforcement Learning applied to ride-sourcing service
- **Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram**
- **Traffic Flow Theory and Signal Control**

Prior to joining the HKUST, I spent 3 wonderful years at [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/), Israel, obtaining my master degree supervised by Asst. Prof. [Jack Haddad](https://haddad.net.technion.ac.il/) and the first year supervised by Prof. [Shlomo Bekhor](https://sbekhor.net.technion.ac.il/) in Transportation Engineering. I got my bachelor's degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin, China in 2013.

Personal
======
I hold a broad range of interests to make a enjoyable and meaningful life. 

I enjoy outdoor and water sports, including Jogging, Hiking, Fishing, Windsurfing (Level 1 certificate),  Scuba Diving (first scuba certification level). And some other sports, like badminton, table tennis, snooker, etc.

I am a self-drive tour enthusiast. I have been travelled to more than 20 countries around the world. I also write some articles on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhengfei-zheng) to answer some interested questions.

<!-- I am an alcoholist, I like the following types of alcohol. 

- Beers, including Pale Ale (I like **Ballast Point**, **Brooklyn**, **Dogfish** and **BrewDog**.), Trappist (I like **Rochefort** and **Chimay**.) and Hefeweizen (I think **Franziskaner** is good enough.). 

- Vodka. **Smirnoff Black, Grey Goose and Russian Standards** are of high quality.

- Whiskey. For single malts, I like **Talisker and Lagavulin**. For blended, **Johnnie Walker Double Black** is worth a try. 

- Bourbon. I have only tried **Maker's Mark** and I found it charming.

- Gin. The taste of Gin is a highly personalized matter. I enjoy **The Botanists**. 

An image demonstrating genres of single malt scotch is [here](http://kl4805.github.io/files/Whiskey.jpeg). -->
