I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Civil Department, [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Hai Yang](http://cehyang.people.ust.hk/), Hong Kong. My primary research interests inlcude smart mobility and data-driven study in tranportation for some emerging problems, including: 
- **Emerging Smart Mobility Service**
    - Ride-sourcing markets
     - Pricing and regulations
     - Ride-pooling matching mechanism
    - Bike Sharing
- **Artificial Intelligence for Transportation**
    - Machine Learning for OD/speed/flow prediction
    - Reinforcement Learning applied to ride-sourcing service
- **Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram**
- **Traffic Flow Theory and Signal Control**

Prior to joining the HKUST, I spent 3 wonderful years at [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/), Israel, obtaining my master degree supervised by Asst. Prof. [Jack Haddad](https://haddad.net.technion.ac.il/) and the first year supervised by Prof. [Shlomo Bekhor](https://sbekhor.net.technion.ac.il/) in Transportation Engineering. I got my bachelor's degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin, China in 2013.

Miscellaneous
======
I hold a broad range of interests so as to keep enjoying life. 

I enjoy sports including jogging and basketball. My favourite team in NBA is San Antonio Spurs and my favourite football club is Liverpool FC. 

I am a civil aviation enthusiast. I am a member of the ACICFG, a team devoted to making subtitles and captions for documentaries related to civil aviation (such as the **Air Crash Investigation**). Some of our works are published on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/358422). I also write some articles on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mai-kang-ming/activities) related to civil aviation and my research. 

I am an alcoholist, I like the following types of alcohol. 

- Beers, including Pale Ale (I like **Ballast Point**, **Brooklyn**, **Dogfish** and **BrewDog**.), Trappist (I like **Rochefort** and **Chimay**.) and Hefeweizen (I think **Franziskaner** is good enough.). 

- Vodka. **Smirnoff Black, Grey Goose and Russian Standards** are of high quality.

- Whiskey. For single malts, I like **Talisker and Lagavulin**. For blended, **Johnnie Walker Double Black** is worth a try. 

- Bourbon. I have only tried **Maker's Mark** and I found it charming.

- Gin. The taste of Gin is a highly personalized matter. I enjoy **The Botanists**. 

An image demonstrating genres of single malt scotch is [here](http://kl4805.github.io/files/Whiskey.jpeg).
