Machine learning relevant research has been so prevalent in a recent decade, but now it seems gradually slowing down. There are so many excellent online materials to boost our study on it. Here I just list a few representatives I have learned, aiming to help those who also want to gain the basic knowledge of machine learning.


* **Machine learning**
  - [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)
Probably, this is one of the most famous online courses about machine learning, given by Andrew Ng from Stanford University. accompanying notes from [github](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Andrew-NG-Notes)
  - [10-601 Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/courses/601sp15/lectures.shtml), by Tom Mitchell and Maria-Florina Balcan from Carnegie Mellon University.
  - [Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/lectures.htm), by Stanford University professors Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani.
  - [Github Tutorial on Machine Learning](https://github.com/Mikoto10032/DeepLearning)

* **Deep learning-CNN**
  - CS231n: [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.](https://cs231n.github.io/)
This is absolutely very admiring open course with a lot of conctrete examples and hands-on coding samples, which are prepared by Prof. [FeiFei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li)'s group from Stanford University. From this course, we can have a bite on deep learning algorithms, starting from the implementation of CNNs into computer vision.

  - [MIT Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lectures](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/), [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/) from MIT. He is an amazing guy, his podcast I heard a lot when exercise.

* **Reinforcement learning**
  - Reinforcement Learning, by [Richard S. Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net/) from University of Alberta, [Solutions to his book](https://github.com/LyWangPX/Reinforcement-Learning-2nd-Edition-by-Sutton-Exercise-Solutions)
