Helpful materials for study on conve optimization and algorithms. Thanks to Prof. [Zaiwen Wen](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/index.html) from Peking University.

## Materials of his three courses 

- [最优化方法](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/opt-2022-fall.html) : Optimization methods
- [凸优化](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/opt-2021-fall.html): Convex Optimization
- [大数据分析中的算法](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/bigdata2022.html): Algorithms for Big Data Analysis 

## His book on optimization algorithms
- [最优化：建模、算法与理论/最优化计算方法](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/optbook.html)


Other resources about optimization I appreciate a lot,  

- Prof. [Bingsheng HE](http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~hebma/) from Nanjing University.
- Prof. [Stephen P. Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/teaching.html) from Stanford University
- Prof. [Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) from Stanford University

Thanks a lot for high quality materials and their generous sharing.
